# MHFTranslate
MHFTranslate is a small console application that automatically parses the logs from Monster Hunter Frontier and translates
it using Google's Cloud Translation API.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing. If you need a
compiled binary, see "Precompiled Binaries" instead.

## Prerequisites
This project makes use of the following NuGet packages:
```
Google.Cloud.Translation.V2
dein.Colorify
Newtonsoft.Json
```

Everything else is pretty self-explanatory. To use this software you need your own Google API key, or use the pre-compiled binaries
available below.
